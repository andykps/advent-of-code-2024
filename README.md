# Advent of Code 2024

My attempts at AOC 2024. I'm trying to use Go which so far is proving exceptionally frustrating...

Please don't treat this code as examples of good Go!

## Day 1
No idea if I'm structuring things well for a Go project. Currently each day is a Go module and inside that there are folders for each star's task containing a file with the main method. I'm putting input files (but not committing) in the day folder and then calling with e.g.
```
go run day1-1/day1-1.go
```
Let's see if I refine this over time. It'd be nice to be able to pass in the input to be used rather than have to edit the source to use example input but I haven't figured out command line args yet!
